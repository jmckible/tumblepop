Welcome to Tumblepop,

Here's how it works: every day we'll email you a question.  Use that question as a starting point for some creative writing.  Write whatever you want - fiction, non-fiction, it doesn't even have to relate to the question.  The idea is to write something new every day.

All you need to do is respond to the email with your story.  To give your story a title, change the subject line of the email.

When your email is received, you'll receive a link to the url.  Everything your write is published to Tumblepop, but only your friends can see your name.  You're free to change your privacy settings at any time.

Right now your password is: <%= @password %>.  You should change it right now.  While you're doing that, tell us a little about yourself: <%= user_url %>

Look for your first question tomorrow!
